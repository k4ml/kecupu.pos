    Note that the default settings.py file created by django-admin.py startproject includes 'django.contrib.auth' and 'django.contrib.contenttypes' in INSTALLED_APPS for convenience. If your INSTALLED_APPS already contains these apps, feel free to run manage.py syncdb again; you can run that command as many times as you’d like, and each time it’ll only install what’s needed.
